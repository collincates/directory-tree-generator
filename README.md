__<h1>Television Post-Production Project Folder Maker</h1>__
<h4>A command-line app for post-production managers who want to quickly set up shop.</h4>
<hr>
<p>It's a big pain to manually re-create your project folder every time you start a new TV show.</p>
<p>So much copying and pasting. So much episode/season re-numbering.</p>
So much why the heck isn't there a better solution for this?<p>

<p>There is.</p>

<p>Use this script to create a skeleton project folder for the season in a few  steps.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Here's how it works:</h4>
<br>
<p>Step 1: Enter the name of your show.</p>

<p>Step 2: Enter which season is about to begin.</p>

<p>Step 3: Enter how many episodes have been ordered for this season.</p>

<p>Step 4: Choose from a few different options of folder organization.</p>

<p>Step 5: That's it.</p>
<hr>
<h4>What folder names are included by default?</h4>

<p>All of your favorites are included*:
<br>
<ul>
<li>ADR</li>
<li>As Broadcast Scripts</li>
<li>Budget</li>
<li>Calendars - Post</li>
<li>Calendars - Production</li>

<p>If you have suggestions, please share them!</p>
<p>The idea here is to create a tool that can set up for any television show's needs, big or small.</p>
